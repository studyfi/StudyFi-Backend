## Project Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
```
bash
git clone https://github.com/studyfi/StudyFi-Backend.git
```
2.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Install MySQL if you don't have it already.
    *   Create a database for the project. You can use the MySQL command line or a GUI tool like MySQL Workbench.
    *   Update the database connection properties in the `application.properties` file for each microservice (e.g., `contentandnews/src/main/resources/application.properties`, `userandgroup/src/main/resources/application.properties`). You will need to configure the database URL, username, and password.

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Configure the necessary environment variables for each microservice. This may include:
        *   Cloudinary credentials (cloud name, API key, API secret)
        *   SMTP server details (host, port, username, password)
        *   Any other service-specific configurations.

4.  **Build the project:**
    *   Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
    *   Build the project using Maven:
```
bash
mvn clean install
```
## Project Folder Structure

The project is organized into several directories, with each microservice residing in its own folder at the root level:

*   `apigateway`: Contains the code for the API Gateway service.
*   `discoveryserver`: Contains the code for the Discovery Server (Eureka).
*   `userandgroup`: Contains the code for the User and Group service.
*   `contentandnews`: Contains the code for the Content and News service.
*   `notification`: Contains the code for the Notification service.

Each service folder typically follows a standard Spring Boot project structure, including directories like `src/main/java` for source code and `src/main/resources` for configuration and static files.


## API Gateway Service

### Project Description
The `apigateway` service, powered by **Spring Cloud Gateway**, serves as the crucial entry point for all client interactions with the StudyFi backend. It eliminates the need for clients to know the specific addresses of individual microservices by providing a unified API.

### Architectural Overview
The API Gateway service is built using **Spring Cloud Gateway**. Its core architecture revolves around **routing configurations**, dynamically determined based on **service discovery** from the Eureka Server. It acts as a reverse proxy, directing incoming client requests to the appropriate downstream microservices. Key components involved include:

*   **Predicates:** Used to match incoming HTTP requests based on various criteria (e.g., path, headers, query parameters).
*   **Filters:** Allow for modifying the request or response, or performing pre/post-processing logic (e.g., authentication, logging, rate limiting).

The Gateway retrieves the available instances of a target service from Eureka and forwards the request, potentially applying load balancing across multiple instances. It commonly runs on port **8080** by default.

### Functionalities
The API Gateway service acts as the single entry point for all client requests to the StudyFi backend. It is responsible for routing incoming requests to the appropriate microservices. Key functionalities include:

*   **Request Routing:** Routing incoming client requests to the appropriate downstream microservices based on predefined routes typically defined in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.
*   **Service Discovery (Eureka Server):** Acts as a Eureka Client and registers with the Eureka Server to discover the network locations (IP address and port) of all registered microservice instances.
*   **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Handling cross-cutting concerns that apply to multiple services, such as:
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Verifying user identity and permissions before requests reach the microservices.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Protecting backend services from excessive requests.
    *   **Logging:** Centralizing request logging.
*   **Load Balancing:** Can potentially handle load balancing across multiple instances of a microservice.

### Routing Configuration Example
The API Gateway's routing is configured in the `application.properties` file. Here is an example of how requests are routed to the `user-service`:
```
properties
spring.cloud.gateway.routes.0.id=user-service
spring.cloud.gateway.routes.0.uri=lb://user-service
spring.cloud.gateway.routes.0.predicates[0]=Path=/api/users/**
```
### Technologies and Components
*   This service is built using **Spring Cloud Gateway**.
*   Key dependencies are listed in the `apigateway/pom.xml` file, including `spring-cloud-starter-gateway` and dependencies for service discovery (Eureka Client).


## Discovery Server
The `discoveryserver` service acts as the **Eureka Server**, which is central to the StudyFi microservices architecture. Its fundamental role is to facilitate **service registration and discovery**.

### Architectural Overview
The Discovery Server's architecture is based on the **Eureka Server** pattern. It functions as a central registry where each microservice in the StudyFi backend registers its instance information (like network location and service ID) upon startup. This registry is then available for clients, primarily the **API Gateway** and potentially other microservices themselves, to query and discover the network addresses of required services. This dynamic discovery mechanism is essential for the microservices to locate and communicate with each other without needing hardcoded configurations.

It serves as the registry where each microservice (like `userandgroup`, `contentandnews`, and `notification`) registers itself upon startup. Other services, including the API Gateway and potentially the microservices themselves for inter-service communication, can query the Discovery Server to obtain the network locations (IP addresses and ports) of the registered service instances. This dynamic discovery allows services to find and communicate with each other without needing hardcoded addresses.

While microservices can communicate directly with each other after discovering their locations via the Eureka Server, the **API Gateway remains the primary entry point for all external client requests**, handling routing and cross-cutting concerns.

The Discovery Server commonly runs on port **8761** by default.

### Functionalities
*   **Service Registration:** Microservices register their instance information (host, port, service ID) with the Eureka Server upon startup.
*   **Service Discovery:** Clients (like the API Gateway or other microservices) can query the Eureka Server to get a list of available instances for a specific service ID.
*   **Heartbeats:** Registered services send periodic heartbeats to the Eureka Server to indicate they are still alive and operational. The server will deregister instances that stop sending heartbeats.

### Technologies and Components
*   This service is built using **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Server**.
*   Key dependencies are listed in the `discoveryserver/pom.xml` file, including `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server`.

### Configuration Details
The `discoveryserver/src/main/resources/application.properties` file contains specific configurations for the Eureka Server. Key properties include:

*   `eureka.instance.hostname=localhost`: Explicitly sets the hostname for the Eureka server instance to `localhost`. Typically used in development or testing environments. In production, this would usually be a proper hostname or IP address.
*   `eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false`: Prevents the Eureka server from registering itself as a client in its own service registry. Standard practice for a Eureka server.
*   `eureka.client.fetch-registry=false`: Instructs the Eureka server not to fetch the service registry from other Eureka servers. Relevant in a single-instance Eureka setup. In a clustered environment, this would be set to `true`.

### How Services Connect and Communicate

Microservices connect to the Discovery Server by including the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client` dependency and configuring the Discovery Server's address in their `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

Upon startup, they register themselves with the Discovery Server. Other services, acting as Eureka Clients, can then query the Discovery Server to obtain the locations of the required service instances.

This enables direct interservice communication using clients like `WebClient` or `Feign Client` that are aware of the Discovery Server. While direct communication is possible internally, the API Gateway remains the single entry point for all external client requests.


## User and Group Service

The `userandgroup` service is responsible for managing user accounts and groups within the StudyFi platform. It handles all operations related to user profiles, authentication, and the creation and management of study groups.

### Architectural Overview

This service is built with **Spring Boot** and leverages **Spring Data JPA** for seamless interaction with the **MySQL database**, handling all data persistence for users and groups. It integrates with **Cloudinary** for efficient file storage, specifically for user profile and cover images, as well as group images. For communication with other microservices, particularly the Notification service for sending emails, it utilizes **WebClient** for asynchronous interactions.

### Functionalities

*   **User Management:**
    *   User Registration and Account Creation
    *   User Login and Authentication
    *   User Profile Management (viewing and updating profile information, including managing **profile images (`profile_image_url`)** and **cover images (`cover_image_url`)**)
    *   Email Verification (for new user accounts)
    *   Password Reset functionality
*   **File Uploads (User and Group Images):**
    *   Handling file uploads for user profile and cover images using Cloudinary.
    *   Handling file uploads for group images using Cloudinary.
*   **Group Management:**
    *   Creating new study groups
    *   Managing group members (listing, potentially adding/removing)

### Database Structures

The User and Group Service interacts with the MySQL database, primarily managing the following tables:

**`user` Table**

*   **Email Functionality:** The presence of fields like `email_verification_code` and `emailVerified` in the User entity indicates email-related features (like verification and password reset). Email sending is handled through SMTP configuration (likely in `application.properties` with a configuration file).
*   **WebClient:** Explicitly utilized for **asynchronous** interservice communication, including making calls to other services for tasks such as sending notifications.

### Custom Exceptions

The service defines custom exceptions within the `com.studyfi.userandgroup.user.exception` package to handle specific error scenarios related to user operations:
*   `EmailNotVerifiedException`: Thrown when an action requires a verified email but the user's email is not verified.
*   `EmailVerificationCodeInvalidException`: Thrown when an provided email verification code is invalid.
*   `InvalidVerificationCodeException`: Thrown when a verification code (potentially for password reset or email verification) is invalid.

### Code Expiration

The `verification_code_expiry` and `email_verification_code_expiry` fields in the `user` table are used to manage the validity periods for password reset and email verification codes, respectively. This ensures that these codes expire after a certain time, enhancing security by preventing indefinite use of a code. The service is responsible for setting these expiration times when codes are generated and checking against them during the verification or reset process.

The service defines custom exceptions within the `com.studyfi.userandgroup.user.exception` package to handle specific error scenarios related to user operations:
*   `EmailNotVerifiedException`: Thrown when an action requires a verified email but the user's email is not verified.
*   `EmailVerificationCodeInvalidException`: Thrown when an provided email verification code is invalid.
*   `InvalidVerificationCodeException`: Thrown when a verification code (potentially for password reset or email verification) is invalid.

The User and Group Service interacts with other microservices in the following ways:

### Interaction with Other Services

*   **Outbound:** It can call the Notification service (via WebClient) to send user or group related notifications.
*   **Inbound:** Other microservices (e.g., Content and News service) may call the User and Group service to retrieve user or group information (like names, profile pictures) to display alongside content or group details.

*   **Inbound:** The API Gateway routes client requests related to content and news to this service. **Additionally**, other services query this service for content after discovering its location via the Discovery Server, which allows for more efficient direct communication.

## Notification Service

### Project Description
The `notification` service is dedicated to handling and sending notifications within the StudyFi platform. It acts as a centralized component for triggering various types of notifications in response to events from other services, ensuring users are informed about relevant activities such as new content, group updates, or account-related events.

### Architectural Overview
Built with **Spring Boot**, the Notification Service is designed to receive notification requests from other microservices. These requests likely contain the necessary information to compose and send a notification (e.g., recipient user ID, message content, notification type). It leverages technologies for sending notifications, such as an SMTP client for emails. Its architecture is focused on processing incoming notification requests efficiently and interacting with external notification delivery systems.

### Functionalities
*   Receiving notification requests from other services.
*   Composing notification messages based on received data.
*   Sending notifications, primarily via email (based on the project's overall technologies).
*   Handling different types of notifications (e.g., user verification, password reset, new comment, group activity).

### Technologies and Components
*   **Spring Boot:** Framework for building the microservice.
*   **WebClient:** Potentially used for receiving requests from other services or interacting with external notification APIs.
*   **SMTP Client (e.g., JavaMailSender):** Used for sending email notifications.
*   **Maven:** Dependency management and build automation.

### Service Interactions
The Notification Service primarily has **inbound** interactions, receiving calls from other services to trigger notifications:
*   **Inbound:** Receives requests from services like the User and Group Service (for email verification, password reset) and the Content and News Service (for new comments, likes, etc.) to send specific notifications to users.
*   **Outbound:** May interact with external services or APIs for delivering notifications (e.g., an external email service via SMTP, or future integrations with push notification services).

### Database Structures
The Notification Service interacts with a database to store notification information. The primary table is `notifications`:

**`notifications` Table**

| Column Name     | Data Type     | Description                       |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
